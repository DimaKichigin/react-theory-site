# A site on React with React theory

The site can be viewed [here](https://dimakichigin.github.io/react-theory-site/) 

On this site, the first tab presents some React theory on the types of React components built in, and the advantages of the React library.
The second tab has a feedback form where you can put your name and ask a question.
